I wondered "What does it look like for a deck of cards to be shuffled randomly...?"

This is basically a playground to do that 

I have a couple of ideas in mind, but the biggest ones are as follows

Where a "fair hand" is defined by a sequence of cards in which there are no 3 number of cards in a row in the deck or 3 of a kind or more

- How many times would it take to get a "fair hand" with different ways of shuffling

- List of changes still needing to be made
	- Clean up issues
	- Call the class from other example scripts with their own shuffling algorithms
	- Provide Documentation for the functionality with example code snippets
