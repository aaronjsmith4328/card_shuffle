I wondered "What does it look like for a deck of cards to be shuffled randomly...?"

This is basically a playground to do that 

I have a couple of ideas in mind, but the biggest ones are as follows

==> Where "random" is defined by a deck in which there are no x number of contiguous cards in a row in the deck

1) How many times would it take to get a "random" set if the bottom card was placed on the top and the deck was split?

... more to come
